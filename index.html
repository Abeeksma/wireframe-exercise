                Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. We have a saboteur aboard. How long can two people talk about nothing? Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? I'll be sure to note that in my log. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. This should be interesting. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? They were just sucked into space. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training.
