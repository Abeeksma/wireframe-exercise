                Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. We have a saboteur aboard. How long can two people talk about nothing? Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? I'll be sure to note that in my log. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. This should be interesting. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? They were just sucked into space. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Your head is not an artifact! Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training.
                In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Not if I weaken first. Travel time to the nearest starbase? The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Your shields were failing, sir. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Your head is not an artifact! Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you.
